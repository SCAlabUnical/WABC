# WABC

Social media platforms are increasingly used to convey advertising campaigns for products or services. A key issue is to identify an appropriate set of influencers within a social network, investing resources to get them to adopt a product. Influence maximization is an optimization problem that aims at finding a small set of users that maximize the spread of influence in a social network.
**Weighted Artificial Bee Colony** (*WABC*) is an influence maximization algorithm, which is based on a bio inspired technique for identifying a subset of users which maximizes the spread. The proposed algorithm can be exploited for identifying the main influencers among social users, and deriving the main information diffusion strategies within the network.
